Overview of the Assignment: Titanic Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning
This repository includes code that looks at the Titanic dataset and uses machine learning models to predict whether passengers survived or not. The Titanic dataset is well-known and is used a lot for tasks like data analysis and machine learning. It has details about Titanic passengers like their age, gender, class, fare, and whether they survived or not.

Reason for Choosing the Dataset:
We picked the Titanic dataset because it's famous and has lots of information about passengers. It's great for practicing things like getting data ready, exploring the data, and trying out machine learning techniques.

How to Use the Code:
Here's what you need to do to run the code and do the analysis:
1. Copy this repository to your computer.
2. Make sure you have the right software (Python) and extra tools (packages) installed. If not, you can easily install them using a tool called "pip".

To do this, you can type a command like "pip install rpy2 pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn".

3. Get the Titanic dataset from a website called Kaggle and save it as a file called "titanic.csv" in a folder called "Python_Assignment10".

4. Open a file named "Assignment10.py" in a tool for writing code (like a special text editor for coding).
5. Run the code in the tool you opened. The code will read the dataset, get it ready for analysis, try two different machine learning methods (Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier), and show how well they did with numbers and graphs.

6. After you run the code, you'll see a special kind of graph (heatmap) that shows how different details in the dataset are related.

Overview of the Assignment: Oasis Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning

This repository contains code that performs an analysis of the Oasis dataset using machine learning models to achieve a specific prediction or analysis task. The Oasis dataset, like the Titanic dataset, provides valuable insights into the subject matter of the dataset, and it serves as an excellent opportunity to practice data analysis and machine learning techniques. 

Reason for Choosing the Dataset:

The Oasis dataset was chosen due to its relevance and rich information, making it an ideal candidate for honing skills related to data preprocessing, exploration, and the application of various machine learning algorithms.

How to Use the Code:

Follow these steps to run the code and perform the analysis:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the necessary software (Python) and required packages installed. If not, you can easily install them using the package manager "pip." Run the following command in your terminal: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn.
Acquire the Oasis dataset from the appropriate source and save it as a file named "oasis.csv" within a folder named "Python_Assignment_Oasis."
Open the file named "dataset2.py" in a suitable integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor for coding.
Execute the code in your chosen IDE. The script will load and preprocess the dataset, apply various machine learning techniques (such as Support Vector Machines or Decision Trees), and present the results both numerically and visually.
Upon running the code, an informative visualization (such as a correlation matrix or feature importance plot) will be generated to illustrate the relationships and insights within the Oasis dataset.
By following these instructions, you will gain valuable experience in conducting data analysis and implementing machine learning methodologies on the Oasis dataset.
