Overview of the Assignment: Titanic Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning
This repository includes code that looks at the Titanic dataset and uses machine learning models to predict whether passengers survived or not. The Titanic dataset is well-known and is used a lot for tasks like data analysis and machine learning. It has details about Titanic passengers like their age, gender, class, fare, and whether they survived or not.

Reason for Choosing the Dataset:
We picked the Titanic dataset because it's famous and has lots of information about passengers. It's great for practicing things like getting data ready, exploring the data, and trying out machine learning techniques.

How to Use the Code:
Here's what you need to do to run the code and do the analysis:
1. Copy this repository to your computer.
2. Make sure you have the right software (Python) and extra tools (packages) installed. If not, you can easily install them using a tool called "pip".

To do this, you can type a command like "pip install rpy2 pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn".

3. Get the Titanic dataset from a website called Kaggle and save it as a file called "titanic.csv" in a folder called "Python_Assignment10".

4. Open a file named "Assignment10.py" in a tool for writing code (like a special text editor for coding).
5. Run the code in the tool you opened. The code will read the dataset, get it ready for analysis, try two different machine learning methods (Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier), and show how well they did with numbers and graphs.

6. After you run the code, you'll see a special kind of graph (heatmap) that shows how different details in the dataset are related.
